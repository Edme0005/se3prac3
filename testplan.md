Test Plan
=========
Intoduction
-----------
The program being tested is 2048. A game in which a 4x4 grid randomly spawns titles and the user
tilts the tiles in a direction, joining tiles of the same value.

The goal of this plan is to test the functionality of the program, ensuring the game works correctly.

The methods used by the game are:

Attributes
----------
The attributes being tested will be to ensure that the task is performed within no noticable time.

This is a game in which the tiles moving should appear instantly, any delay is to long.

Components
----------
This is a list of major code parts.
* Board[][] array.
* tilt_left
* rotate_90

Capabilities 
------------
The componants needing testing are:
* tilt up
* tilt right
* tilt down
* tilt left
* spawn new tile

Conclusion
----------
not sure
